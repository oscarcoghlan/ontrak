##React time  
lets start slowly, todo:  
- Create some kind of user login page that someone can use to create an account. Email validation by regex or something.  
1. Just create the page with boxes
2. Database and stuff, password salting and hashing and whatever.  
3. make it real time? like no post or requests or anything. (could be hard idk).  
4. Homemade captcha? that could be cool.
